  bio: Abhijnan works primarily in AI for natural language understanding (NLU) and computational semantics, spanning topics like coreference resolution and cognate detection, transformer-based language models, and their downstream applications with a drive to extend such research to low-resource languages. He holds an MSc. in Physics (minor in Computer Science) from Birla Institute of Technology and Science (BITS), Pilani, India and studied Rawlsian Political theory at JNU, New Delhi. In the past, he has collaborated with the Jackson Lab, Stanford University, and the Natural Resource Ecology Lab, CSU to build their atmospheric N20 prediction pipeline using time-series data exploration. He is a big fan of Pavarotti, Bach, and Dream Theater and loves to work on his musical projects when he is not dealing with CUDA tensors!

  bio: Anju is a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at Colorado State University. She did her Master's in Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Madras, India. Previously, she has worked at Subex Ltd., Intel India Pvt. Ltd and Oppo US Research Centre. Her main research interests are hand grasps and [affordances](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs137/2017/readings/Gibson-AFF.pdf). Among other things, this has applications in robots tasked to pick, transfer and place objects at desired locations in factories, or avatars interacting with objects in mixed reality environments.  In her free time, she enjoys trying out new recipes and watching good movies. She also volunteers as a mentor for CSU undergrads.  Among her other interests is science communication.

  bio: Carine has a background in foreign language acquisition and applied linguistics. She holds a Ph.D. in natural language translation studies from Kent State University, Ohio and  obtained her Master's in computer science from SMU in Dallas, Texas. Her research interests lie at the intersection of LLM alignment, speech recognition, ethics, and language translation. Carine is particularly interested in how aligned LLMs can support responsible multilingual systems that integrate speech and text. A central ethical concern in her research is the exclusion of certain accents and underrepresented languages in speech recognition systems, which reinforces linguistic inequities but also marginalizes individuals who rely on these systems due to disabilities. Her work investigates how to build more inclusive models that not only translate accurately across languages, but also recognize diverse speech patterns, ensuring fair and accountable AI-mediated communication. In her free time, Carine loves hiking in the Rockies, cooking, and baking her own *miches campagne* (round loaves of French sourdough).
