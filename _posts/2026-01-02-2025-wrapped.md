I have been rushed off my feet since last April and haven't found time to update the website. Suffice to say that 2025 was a very successful year. Since the last update, we had papers at [NA](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-demo.5/)[ACL](https://aclanthology.org/2025.naacl-long.190/), [ACL](https://aclanthology.org/2025.acl-long.542/), and [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/virtual/2025/loc/san-diego/poster/115167), among others. We had very successful demo days at DARPA and ARPA-H, the iSAT project [got renewed](https://www.colorado.edu/today/2025/07/29/research-institute-building-ai-literate-workforce-future-receives-major-new-grant-0), and our work on providing [healthcare upskilling for rural America](https://elements.colostate.edu/csu-leads-ai-development-for-use-in-mobile-rural-health-clinic/) was in the news.  We ran a [new workshop](https://origen-workshop.github.io/) at COLM. Multiple students completed milestones toward their degrees, and multiple new students will be joining the lab in 2026. Here's to 2026 being more relaxed, but equally successful!
